# Algorithm Visualizer

Interactive web app that allows users to visualize algorithms with custom inputs. Made entirely with vanilla JavaScript, it manages its own state and uses GSAP to create CSS animations. Mostly mobile-friendly, with the canvas (the area where animations play) resizing dynamically to always ensure a pixel-perfect fit.

## Deployment

Want to deploy this yourself? The site runs entirely client-side, so anything able to host static sites can host this, as shown by our deployment on Pages (https://kaiyan-da-man.github.io/algorithm-visualizer/)
