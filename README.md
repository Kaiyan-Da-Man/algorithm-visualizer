# Algorithm Visualizer

Interactive web app that allows users to visualize algorithms with custom inputs. Made entirely with vanilla JavaScript, it manages its own state and uses GSAP to create CSS animations. Mostly mobile-friendly, with the canvas (the area where animations play) resizing dynamically to always ensure a pixel-perfect fit.

## Built With

* [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) - Library used for CSS animations
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used their styled components
* Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
