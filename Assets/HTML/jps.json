        "desc":"Jump point search is a modified A* that differs in its use of <b>graph pruning</b> to ignore nodes that, due to characteristics of the current node, will not be useful in the search. For example, when searching in an open area, JPS will <b>jump past</b> nodes in a straight line between two points of interest, such as nodes near walls that form a corner."
